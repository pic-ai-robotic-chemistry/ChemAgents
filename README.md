## Other Information

ChemAgents relies on LangChain’s [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) for seamless integration of LLMs with user-defined custom tools.

The instruction set of the robotic AI chemist has been made open-source and is available at [AIChemist_Instructions](https://aichem.ustc.edu.cn/AIChemistAtUSTC/AIChemist_Instructions).

The self-developed drivers for the AGV from HangFa Robotics and utilized in our work, are available at [Drivers_for_HangFaAGV](https://git.lug.ustc.edu.cn/ST/Drivers_for_HangFaAGV).

For the robot drivers for the UR5e robotic arm from Universal Robots, please refer to [Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_Driver).
